## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates mastery of the following React concepts:

### Core React Concepts

- ‚úÖ **Functional Components** - Modern React component patterns
- ‚úÖ **React Hooks** - useState, , useContext, useReducer
- ‚úÖ **Props & State** - Data flow and component communication
- ‚úÖ **Event Handling** - User interaction management
- ‚úÖ **Conditional Rendering** - Dynamic UI based on state

### Advanced State Management

- ‚úÖ **Context API** - Global state without prop drilling
- ‚úÖ **useReducer** - Complex state logic and actions
- ‚úÖ **State Normalization** - Efficient data structure management
- ‚úÖ **Immutable Updates** - Proper state mutation patterns

## üìã Requirements

### Adding Products to Cart

1. Browse the product grid in the "Your Products" section
2. Click "Add to Cart" button on any available product
3. Product will appear in the "YOUR CART" section
4. Stock will automatically decrease

### Managing Cart Items

1. **Increase Quantity**: Click the "+" button next to any cart item
2. **Decrease Quantity**: Click the "-" button (minimum quantity is 1)
3. **Remove Item**: Click the "√ó" button to remove item completely

### Searching Products

1. Use the search bar in the header
2. Type product name to filter results
3. Clear search to show all products

### Sorting Products

1. Use the "Sort by" dropdown next to "Your Products"
2. Choose from:
   - **Most Popular** - Based on popularity rating
   - **Newest** - Based on date added
   - **Price** - Lowest to highest price

## üß† Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Context API Implementation

\`\`\`javascript
// Creating Context
const CartContext = createContext()

// Provider Component
export const CartProvider = ({ children }) => {
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(cartReducer, initialState)

return (
<CartContext.Provider value={{ ...state, ...actions }}>
{children}
</CartContext.Provider>
)
}

// Custom Hook
export const useCart = () => {
const context = useContext(CartContext)
if (!context) {
throw new Error('useCart must be used within a CartProvider')
}
return context
}
\`\`\`

### 2. useReducer for Complex State

\`\`\`javascript
const cartReducer = (state, action) => {
switch (action.type) {
case 'ADD*TO_CART':
// Complex state update logic
return { ...state, /* updated state _/ }
case 'REMOVE_FROM_CART':
// Another state update
return { ...state, /_ updated state \_/ }
default:
return state
}
}
\`\`\`

### 3. State Management Patterns

- **Immutable Updates**: Always return new state objects
- **Action Creators**: Consistent action dispatching
- **State Normalization**: Efficient data structure organization
- **Derived State**: Computing values from existing state

### 4. Component Communication

- **Props Down**: Passing data to child components
- **Events Up**: Handling user interactions
- **Context**: Sharing state across component tree
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable stateful logic

### 5. Real-world Application Patterns

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Search & Filter**: Data manipulation techniques
- **Form Handling**: User input validation and processing
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
